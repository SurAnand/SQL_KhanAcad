# Learn SQL

### Today, July 27, 2015

This is my attempt to learn SQL using [Khan Academy SQL Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/sql) and the repo contains all the SQL scripts worked out during the course projects and spin-offs.

The `solar_system_objects` dataset is taken from [here](https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/30acd9ca938c8a62fb92).

Out of the 4 sections in the course, 2 are completed. 

- SQL Basics
- More Advanced SQL Queries
- Relational Queries in SQL
- Modifying Databases with SQL
- *Further Learning in SQL*

Eager to finish this at the earliest!
